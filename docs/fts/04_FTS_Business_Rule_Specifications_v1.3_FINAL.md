### 2. Detailed Business Rule Specifications

#### BR-FTS-001 — Institute Employee Operational Access Rule
* **Rule Type:** Authorization
* **Rule Statement:** Only Institute Employee users (Faculty/Staff operating under assigned roles) may perform operational file-processing actions in FTS.
* **Applies To:** Operational file actions (creation, editing, forwarding, return, archival).
* **Condition / Trigger:** Whenever an operational file action is requested.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Allow operational processing only for authorized Institute Employees; System Admin remains strictly outside routine operational file processing.

#### BR-FTS-002 — Role Switching Preservation Rule
* **Rule Type:** Constraint
* **Rule Statement:** Switching assigned role context shall not change existing file ownership or previously recorded audit history.
* **Applies To:** Role-context switching.
* **Condition / Trigger:** An Institute Employee selects another assigned role context in the dashboard.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Apply the selected role to authorization while preserving ownership and historical audit identity.

#### BR-FTS-003 — Persistent Composite File Rule
* **Rule Type:** Data / Lifecycle Constraint
* **Rule Statement:** An FTS file is a persistent composite object containing mandatory user comments at creation/movement stages and optional attachments; circulated contents and movement records are retained.
* **Applies To:** File object and accumulated contents.
* **Condition / Trigger:** File creation or movement adds content to a file.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Persist the file and accumulated contents after circulation; do not delete circulated contents through draft-discard behavior.
* **Exceptions:** A pre-submission draft may be discarded under BR-FTS-005.

#### BR-FTS-004 — Initial Comment Requirement
* **Rule Type:** Validation
* **Rule Statement:** A new FTS file requires an initial mandatory user comment.
* **Applies To:** File creation.
* **Condition / Trigger:** Employee attempts to create/save a new file.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Block acceptance of file creation until the initial comment is present.

#### BR-FTS-005 — Draft Boundary Rule
* **Rule Type:** Lifecycle Constraint
* **Rule Statement:** Draft save/edit/discard behavior is permitted only before submission/circulation; a circulated file is not deleted as a draft.
* **Applies To:** Draft management and initial circulation.
* **Condition / Trigger:** Draft management or first circulation is attempted.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Permit draft operations only in pre-circulation state and prevent draft deletion after circulation.

#### BR-FTS-006 — File-Movement Comment Requirement
* **Rule Type:** Validation
* **Rule Statement:** Every file-movement action requires a mandatory comment from the acting user.
* **Applies To:** Forwarding and return.
* **Condition / Trigger:** Employee attempts to forward or return a file.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Block movement until the mandatory movement comment is supplied.

#### BR-FTS-007 — Receiver and Return Eligibility Rule
* **Rule Type:** Eligibility / Routing
* **Rule Statement:** A file may be sent to another Institute Employee regardless of the receiver’s role, and a received file may be returned to its sender where the current user is permitted to act.
* **Applies To:** Forwarding and return.
* **Condition / Trigger:** A recipient is selected or Return is requested.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Accept only a valid Institute Employee recipient for send/forward; route return to the sender of the received movement, subject to authorization/file-state permissions.

#### BR-FTS-008 — Chronological Movement Record Rule
* **Rule Type:** Audit / Record Constraint
* **Rule Statement:** FTS shall record forwarding and return events chronologically with sender, receiver, timestamp, movement comment, and movement attachments where present.
* **Applies To:** File movement tracking/history.
* **Condition / Trigger:** A forward or return movement succeeds.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Append movement event and its details to chronological history; update holder/pending-recipient information consistently.

#### BR-FTS-009 — Associated File Access Rule
* **Rule Type:** Authorization
* **Rule Statement:** FTS shall expose file contents/history only to users authorized and associated with the file, including Inbox/Outbox access; archived files remain readable to authorized users.
* **Applies To:** Inbox, Outbox, file/history reading.
* **Condition / Trigger:** A user requests file or history access.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Show/open only authorized associated files and retain authorized read access after archival.

#### BR-FTS-010 — Role-Based Access and Sensitive Action Rule
* **Rule Type:** Authorization
* **Rule Statement:** FTS shall enforce RBAC, assigned-role restrictions, file association, and file-state authorization for FTS actions, including integrations.
* **Applies To:** All FTS operations and integrations.
* **Condition / Trigger:** Any protected FTS action is requested.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Permit only actions authorized by role/context/file association/file state; reject unauthorized sensitive actions.

#### BR-FTS-011 — Audit Log and Chronological Versioning Rule
* **Rule Type:** Audit / Lifecycle
* **Rule Statement:** FTS shall maintain audit records for creation, comments, attachments, forwarding, return, archival, and integration actions, and maintain chronological version history through recorded file updates.
* **Applies To:** Audit/versioning.
* **Condition / Trigger:** An auditable FTS action occurs.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Append applicable audit/version record without rewriting prior chronological history.

#### BR-FTS-012 — Archival Rule
* **Rule Type:** Lifecycle / Authorization
* **Rule Statement:** Only the file owner may archive a completed circulated file; archived files remain permanently stored/readable to authorized users and are no longer modifiable or forwardable in collaborative processing.
* **Applies To:** File archival.
* **Condition / Trigger:** Archive is requested or an action is attempted on an archived file.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Allow archival only for the owner after collaborative completion; enforce archived read-only/no-forward state.

#### BR-FTS-013 — Notification Trigger and Delivery Boundary Rule
* **Rule Type:** Trigger / Scope Boundary
* **Rule Statement:** FTS shall trigger notifications for file received, file forwarded, file returned, file archived, and relevant role assignment/reassignment events; delivery uses Fusion integrated notification mechanisms.
* **Applies To:** FTS notification events.
* **Condition / Trigger:** A source-listed FTS event occurs.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Create/trigger required notification event and hand it to the Fusion notification mechanism.

#### BR-FTS-014 — FTS Integration Boundary Rule
* **Rule Type:** Scope / Integration Constraint
* **Rule Statement:** FTS may provide file/workflow tracking APIs, approval-chain support, and file-based request tracking to other Fusion modules, while consuming modules retain ownership of their domain-specific actors, forms, policies, validations, and workflow semantics.
* **Applies To:** Inter-module API integration.
* **Condition / Trigger:** A consuming Fusion module invokes an FTS service.
* **Required Outcome / Constraint:** Provide only authorized FTS capabilities under FTS RBAC/audit rules; do not assume ownership of consuming-module domain policy.
