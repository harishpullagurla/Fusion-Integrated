### 1. Registry Discipline
The final registry uses two explicit levels. CFRs preserve complete, independently understandable obligations; AFRs preserve distinct verifiable sub-obligations. The earlier FTS-FR identifiers and wording are not retrospectively rewritten: they are retained in the historical crosswalk. Historical FTS-FR-001 is treated as an umbrella statement rather than a final AFR, and historical FTS-FR-007 is decomposed because its three governance responsibilities are independently verifiable.
